> ### tRPC.io, Couchbase and Cbjs codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with tRPC.io, Couchbase and Cbjs including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the TypeScript community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

## Codebase
Each functional domain is located in `src/domains`.
The domains themselves declare a sub-router and some business logic.

In `src/database` you will find the documents' schemas.  
We've decided to use `arktype` as the runtime validator.

The types inferred from the schemas are used to create the [cluster types](https://cbjs.dev/guide/cluster-types.html) of the application.  
Thanks to the amazing [cbjs](https://cbjs.dev) library, this will provide us with type safety and code completion for our database operations.

## Tests

You will find the tests in `tests/suites`, where each directory contains the tests of each domain.  
The tests use `vitest` ‚ö°Ô∏èand tRPC server-side callers to perform the API tests.

A helper, `createAuthenticatedTestContext()`, will create a tRPC caller, register and authenticated a new user, so you don't have to do that for every tests.

If you check the file `src/database/conduitClusterConfig.ts` you will see all the keyspaces and their indexes defined in a single object, along with our Couchbase user.  
When starting the tests, vitest will call `tests/setupTestsOnce.ts` which will use `@cbjsdev/deploy` (see [documentation](https://cbjs.dev/guide/deploy/cluster-config.html)) to update the keyspaces and indexes of your Couchbase container. No manual step required ‚ú® 

## GitHub Actions

As a bonus, you will find in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` a GitHub Actions workflow to run the tests of your application üéÅ.  
It is advised to run this on a large runner, the default ones are tiny tiny and can't run Couchbase consistently.

# Getting started

Create the couchbase container by running `bash ./tests/scripts/createCouchbaseContainer.sh`

```bash
nvm install
pnpm i
pnpm run dev # The server will be reloaded when a change is detected
```

To build the app and start in production mode :

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```
